# The_Friend_App
## Description

The Friend App is an app that allows users to create a list of friends in which keeps track of their names and contact information. I had developed this app using Ruby on Rails along with the Ruby Gem package, devise, for the user authentication processing. This is my first app using Rails in which introduced me to its full-stack abilities and how to apply its CRUD functions. I was also able to dive into applying notifications, error handling, and how to modify the schema, models, and their controllers. This app was deployed through Heroku.
